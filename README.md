# MTG-Card-Identifier

Developed using Jupyter Notebooks and Python version 3.9.7

This is a personal project I've been working on to allow easier online gameplay with the Trading Card Game, Magic the Gathering.

This program is currently able to find trading cards from a live camera-feed by extracting frames from the video feed and blurring and grayscaling each frame and searching for contours with 4 distinct sides within a set range of area sizes.

Working on processing each card using a perceptual hash to compare with a pre-processed hash table. As well as scraping a website for an HD version of identified cards.
